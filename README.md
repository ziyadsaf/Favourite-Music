# Favourite-Music

Welcome to my Favourite Music app!

Why did I build this?
I use Spotify everyday and love to find out what my most played songs or albums are. There are already apps that can do this but I want to create one that generates a graphic that you can share on social media with your favourite artists, albums and songs. I've always wanted to create an application that uses the Spotify API as well!

Languages I will use:
Python - for the back-end of the program
